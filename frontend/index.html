  <h3>Trading Instructions</h3>
  <p>Outgoing bitcoin sends require a 1000 sat fee transaction as an anti-spam measure. Fee transactions must be sent out before the trade and are non-refundable.</p>
  <p>The out chain for USDC is Zksync Era. Zksync Era was chosen because it is the only ETH rollup with trustless withdraws.</p>
  <p>To generate inbound capacity, first trade Bitcoin to USDC. Your inbound capacity will be the net size of the trades you send out.</p>

  <h3>Trade (BTC to USDC)</h3>
